Infinite Jest
David Foster Wallace
02/1/1996
For the Clipperton legend derived from the fact that this Clipperton kid owned a hideous and immaculately maintained Glock 17 semiautomatic sidearm that came in a classy little leather-handled blond-wood case with German High Gothic script on it and a velvet gun-shaped concavity inside where the Glock 17 lay nestled in plush velvet, gleaming...

A Wild Sheep Chase
Haruki Murakami
12/31/1989
"I guess I felt attached to my weakness. My pain and suffering too. Summer light, the smell of a breeze, the sound of cicadas - if I like these things, why should I apologize. The same with having a beer with you..."

The Pale King
David Foster Wallace
04/15/2011
Everyone hates the boy. It is a complex hatred, one that often causes the haters to feel mean and guilty and to hate themselves for feeling this way about such an accomplished and well-meaning boy, which then tends to make them involuntarily hate the boy even more for arousing such self-hatred. The whole thing is totally confusing and upsetting. People take a lot of aspirin when he's around.

Ningen Shikkaku
Osamu Dazai
1958
Indeed, I think Yoshiko had a divine gift for trusting people. She never suspected anything about my relationship with the Madam from Kobayashi, and even when I told her about the Kamakura incident she didn't believe there had been anything between Tsuneko and me.

The Setting Sun
Osamu Dazai

Mr. Uehara drank his sake from a tumbler, instead of the usual little cup. He asked them to bring another glass and offered me some. I drank two glassfuls but did not feel anything. Mr. Uehara drank and smoked, still without uttering a word. This was the first time in my life I had ever come to such a place, but I felt quite at home and rather happy.

No sooner had he flashed this smile than he set to work. His men held Yamamoto down with their hands while he began skinning Yamamoto with the utmost care.

Murasaki Shikibu
Before 1021 BC
In the summer the boy's mother, feeling vaguely unwell, asked that she be allowed to go home. The emperor would not hear of it. Since they were by now used to these indispositions, he begged her to stay and see what course her health would take.
